* lab 01: segment display

Second lab that I did in hackespace.

Assembly project created in Atmel Studio and flashed on Atmega16 on
Pinboard2 Rev 2. It used one of the atmega timers, and port d to
supply data into 7seg display.

Started with 8Mhz frequency for MCU and switched to 1Mhz
** Table of MCU frequency, OCR1A value and fusebits for avrdude

OCR1A â€” output control register for timer counter 1.

| freq  |   dec |    hex | fusebits (xHL) |
| 8 Mhz | 31250 | 0x7A12 |         0xE4D9 |
| 2 Mhz |  7813 | 0x1E85 |         0xE2D9 |
| 1 Mhz |  3907 | 0x0C19 |         0xE1D9 |

How to calculate:
1. 256 / freq = x
2. 1 / x = res
3. Round and convert to hex
